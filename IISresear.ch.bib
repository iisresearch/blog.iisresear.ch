abstract = {In many industries, companies deliver customised solutions to their (business) customers within projects. Estimating the human effort involved in such projects is a difficult task and underestimating efforts can lead to non-billable hours, i.e. financial loss on the side of the solution provider. Previous work in this area has focused on automatic estimation of the cost of software projects and has largely ignored the interaction between automated estimation support and human project leads. Our main hypothesis is that an adequate design of such interaction will increase the acceptance of automatically derived estimates and that it will allow for a fruitful combination of data-driven insights and human experience. We therefore build a recommender that is applicable beyond software projects and that suggests job positions to be added to projects and estimated effort of such positions. The recommender is based on the analysis of similar cases (case-based reasoning), “explains” derived si milarities and allows human intervention to manually adjust the outcomes. Our experiments show that recommendations were considered helpful and that the ability of the system to explain and adjust these recommendations was heavily used and increased the trust in the system. We conjecture that the interaction of project leads with the system will help to further improve the accuracy of recommendations and the support of human learning in the future.},

In these situations, apart from personal preferences of users, knowledge about objective business-driven criteria plays a role. We investigate strategies for representing and incorporating such knowledge into data-driven recommenders. As a baseline, we choose a robust and flexible paradigm that is based on a simple graph-based representation of past customer cases and choices, in combination with biased random walks. On a real data set from a business intelligence consultancy firm, we study how the incorporation of two important types of explicit human knowledge – namely taxonomic and associative knowledge – impacts the effectiveness of a data-driven recommender. Our results show no consistent improvement for taxonomic knowledge, but quite substantial and significant gains when using associative knowledge.},

abstract = {Decision makers use models to understand and analyze a situation, to compare alternatives and to find solutions. Additionally, there are systems that support decision makers through data analysis, calculation or simulation. Typically, modeling languages for humans and machine are different from each other. While humans prefer graphical or textual models, machine-interpretable models have to be represented in a formal language. This chapter describes an approach to modeling that is both cognitively adequate for humans and processable by machines. In addition, the approach supports the creation and adaptation of domain-specific modeling languages. A metamodel which is represented as a formal ontology determines the semantics of the modeling language. To create a graphical modeling language, a graphical notation can be added for each class of the ontology. Every time a new modeling element is created during modeling, an instance for the corresponding class is created in the ontology. Thus, models for humans and machines are based on the same internal representation.},

abstract = {The accessibility of project knowledge that is obtained from experiences is an important and crucial issue in enterprises. Therefore, we introduce an ontology-based case-based reasoning approach that utilises an enterprise ontology, which is based on an enterprise architecture. Utilising this enterprise ontology enables improvements of the case-based reasoning system through the systematic inclusion of enterprise-specific knowledge. This enterprise- specific knowledge is captured in the enterprise ontology named ArchiMEO, an ontological realisation of the enterprise architecture framework ArchiMate and others. This ontology, containing historical cases and specific enterprise domain knowledge, is applied in the new ontology-based case-based reasoning approach. Apart from that, we observed that different people in different roles have their own information needs. Therefore, we enhanced our ontology-based case-based reasoning approach in a way that different views, viewpoints, concerns and stakeholders can be considered. This is realised using a case viewpoint model derived from the ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 standard. The introduced approach is implemented as a demonstrator and evaluated using an application case that has been elicited from a business partner in the Swiss research project.},

abstract = {Knowledge and knowledge work are key factors of today's successful companies. This study devises an approach for increasing the performance of knowledge work by shifting it towards a process orientation. Business process management and workflow management are methods for structured and predefined work but are not flexible enough to support knowledge work in a comprehensive way. Case-based reasoning (CBR) uses the knowledge of previously experienced cases in order to propose a solution to a problem. CBR can be used to retrieve, reuse, revise, retain and store functional and process knowledge. The aim of the research was to develop an approach that combines CBR and process execution to improve knowledge work. The research goals are: a case description for knowledge work that can be integrated into a process execution system and that contains both functional and process knowledge; a similarity algorithm for the retrieval of functional and procedural knowledge; and an adaptation mechanism that deals with the different granularities of solution parts. This thesis contains a profound literature framework and follows a design science research (DSR) strategy. During the awareness phase of the design science research process, an application scenario was acquired using the case study research method, which is the admission process for a study programme at a university. This application scenario is used to introduce and showcase the combined CBR and process execution approach called ICEBERG-PE, which consists of a case model and CBR services. The approach is implemented as a prototype and can be instantiated using the ICEBERG-PE procedure model, a specific procedure model for ontology-based, CBR projects. The ICEBERG-PE prototype has been evaluated using triangulated evaluation data and different evaluation settings to confirm that the approach is transferable to other contexts. Finally, this thesis concludes with potential recommendations for future research.},

As process executions often differ from the original design due to individual preferences, skills or competencies and exceptions, we propose methods to analyse personal preferences of work, such as email communication and personal task execution in a task management application. Outcome of these methods is the detection of internal substructures (subtasks or branches) of activities on the one hand and the recommendation of resources to be used in activities on the other hand, leading to the improvement of business process models. Our first results show that even though human intervention is still required to operationalise these insights it is indeed possible to derive interesting and new insights about business processes from traces of informal work and infer suggestions for process model changes.},

It is based on the insight that – while offering valuable context information – traditional business process modelling approaches are too rigid and inflexible to capture the actual way processes are executed. Therefore, business process models are made agile and open for changes during execution. To achieve this, the strict distinction between build time modelling and run time execution are softened and process activities are represented to the users in a way that allows for individual adaptations. That can be done by attaching resources, commenting on an issue or adding problems and solutions to an activity or process. In addition activities can be delegated or new (sub-)activities can be added. Thus, the model can adapt to the reality of actual process executions and valuable resources and experiences are proactively presented to users in the right context. A double-staged approach is chosen to apply the model in the real application scenario of an university.},

abstract = {Even the smallest enterprise has to manage so much information and documents, that a system for arranging these things is needed; even if it is a small binder. Now when we think about the amount of information which today exists in a company, we have surely to say, that information and knowledge management is not done by only one binder – the companies nowadays need something more sophisticated. What companies nowadays need is information about information – metadata. If metadata is available, then the finding and filing process can be dramatically im-proved. But if the metadata is not available, it needs to be created – and this has to be done in most of the cases by hand. Would it not be great to have an automatic approach? This thesis introduces an approach for creating metadata in an automatic way based on rules and a formal description of an enterprise. We often hear the statement that a company has the information available – “We have the information in our systems.” But it is the question how the information is available. The Linked Enterprise Models and Objects (LEMO) approach gives the possibility to formalize the information in an enterprise. And not only the infor-mation, LEMO tries to make the relationships / links between different enterprise objects, documents, people, customers, money, almost everything in an enterprise explicit and machine process able using an ontology called enterprise model ontolo-gy (EMO). This EMO can be seen as context description of an entire enterprise. And this context can be used to create metadata using rules. The thesis provides beside the EMO and LEMO approach a demonstrator who shows the possibility of creating metadata using the mentioned ontology and semantic rules. The whole approach comes accompanied by an application scenario based on a real world case.},

abstract = {Die Income Suite der Firma dient der Modellierung, Analyse, Optimierung und Dokumentierung von Gesch{\"{a}}ftsprozessen auf Basis von Petri-Netzen. Die Income Toolsuite blickt auf ein {\"{u}}ber zehnj{\"{a}}hriges Bestehen zur{\"{u}}ck und wird zurzeit in der Version 4 produktiv bei diversen Kunden eingesetzt. Die Version 5 von Income ist zurzeit in Entwicklung, existiert als Beta- Version und basiert wie die vorangegangen Versionen auch auf Petri- Netzen. Im Rahmen der elektronischen Ausf{\"{u}}hrung von Gesch{\"{a}}ftsprozessen mittels Workflowsystemen ist der BPEL-Standard in aller Munde. Oft wird durch Presse und grosse Hersteller suggeriert, Gesch{\"{a}}ftsprozessmanagement kann nur mit BPEL umgesetzt werden. Jedoch sieht die Realit{\"{a}}t anders aus – XPDL und andere auch propriet{\"{a}}re Sprachen sind gang und g{\"{a}}be. Der Auftrag war es, der Firma eine Grundlage mit konkreten Handlungsempfehlungen f{\"{u}}r die weitere Entwicklung der Income Suite im Bereich von Workflowmanagement zu liefern. Die konkreten Ziele dieser Arbeit sind f{\"{u}}r Income eine geeignete Transformationssprache zu finden, Integrationsans{\"{a}}tze f{\"{u}}r IT- Systeme aufzuzeigen und ein Workflow- Konzept zu erstellen. Ein weiteres Ziel war es eine lauff{\"{a}}hige Workflow- Implementation basierend auf einem DEMO Prozess zu erstellen. Die Ergebnisse liegen in schriftlich, in Form eines Berichts und elektronisch in Form von implementierten Gesch{\"{a}}ftsprozessen vor. Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse sind: 1. Transformation von Gesch{\"{a}}ftsprozessen 2. Gegen{\"{u}}berstellung von XPDL und BPEL 3. Evaluation von Workflow- Systemen 4. Modell der Web service- basierten Workflow Implementation 5. Anwendungsbeispiel 6. Handlungsempfehlungen f{\"{u}}r die Income Suite},
